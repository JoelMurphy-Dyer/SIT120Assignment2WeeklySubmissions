<h2>Strings with javascript, task 1 week3</h2>

<p>This week I am learning about the length property, as you can see it returns the length of the string:</p>

<p id="Task"></p>

<script>
let text = "Hi my name is Joel";
document.getElementById("Task").innerHTML = text.length;
</script>

</body>
</html>
